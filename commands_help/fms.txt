fms stands for "finish my sentence". Use this command to create a game where players build a sentence together.

**Example:**

**#prefix#fmsstart**
Hello,
we
are
creating
a
sentence!
**#prefix#fmsend**

Every message that is between fmsstart and fmsend will be gathered to form a new sentence. So for the example above you are expected to receive:

Hello, we are creating a sentence! - | Authors |

Every person that helped building the sentence will have its name featured in the authors part.
